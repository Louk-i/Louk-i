Hi hi!

my name is Lou or Louki,
I'm currently a university student, studying how to code, I'm always interested to learn something new and I learn new things quickly !

Languages: Python 3, Java, LUA, C/C++, SQL, Golang
Learning: Javascript, Rust, Kotlin, Swift

I want to learn more about AI and maybe make a game or two along the way. I like playing games a lot.
